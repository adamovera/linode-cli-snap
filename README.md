# Linode CLI (Snap Package)

[![Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/linode-cli/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/linode-cli)

The [Linode CLI](https://github.com/linode/linode-cli) is a wrapper around the [Linode API](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/api), which gives you the ability to manage your [Akamai Cloud Computing](https://www.linode.com) account from the command line. Almost any task that can be done through Cloud Manager can also be performed through the CLI.

> **Note:** This repository maintains the Snap package for the Linode CLI.
> The CLI itself is developed and maintained by the Linode engineering team.
